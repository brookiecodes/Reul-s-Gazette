            <p>Only a couple months into 2023 and there is already growing concern for a new strain of chrontonitis that could prove fatal to many citizens around the globe. The CDC is tracking and investigating this new strain's appearance and have issued an emergency countrywide lockdown.

Many citizens are refusing to stay indoors and are even issuing statewide protest in countless cities across the nation. With this division of sentiment causing a riff throughout the country, people are fearful of not only each other, but also this virus threatening their lives as it continues to spread. We urge our readers to stay inside and protected at all times. </p>
